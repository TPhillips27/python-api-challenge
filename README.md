1. As expected from elementary school learning, the closer to the equator (0o latitude) the higher the temperature.  The further away from the equator you get the cooler the temperature. 

2. The northern hemisphere max temp vs latitude linear regression has more points on it than the southern hemisphere plot. If a person were to look at them and ask why there are fewer plots then the answer would be that the northern part of the northern hemisphere is more populated than the southern part of the southern hemisphere as there is more land to be inhabited.

3. The heatmap with hotels only has a few hotels popup.  The surprising part is the lack of hotels that appear for similar latitudes.  Three appear at roughly +/-24, +/- 70. The fact that more donâ€™t appear at similar coordinates or at least more on similar latitudes or longitudes shows how much weather can change just through the influence of being location near water or not.
